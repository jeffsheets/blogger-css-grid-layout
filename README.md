A CSS Grid Responsive layout Blogger Template, based on the Awesome Inc theme

## What is this?
It is a responsive, mobile-friendly, CSS Grid layout for [Blogger](blogger.com)

## Where can I see it in action?
It is running my Uncommented Bytes blog at [www.sheetsj.com](https://www.sheetsj.com)

## But why?
I've been on Blogger for 17+ years now, and decided in 2021 to update the template to something more modern. To my surprise, nothing existed that was:

1. Responsive
1. "simple"
1. Mobile-friendly
1. using anything remotely close to a CSS Grid layout.

## How?
So I started from a simple base template called "Awesome Inc" that is a default option in Blogger. This is why there is a bunch of cruft around the edges in this template....

Lots of TODOs, but hey it works, so ship it and iterate later!

## No really, but why Blogger? In 2021?
Well I have a few excuses for this beautiful travesty of a template:

- The Blogger UI is simple and easy to write in
- Cause I'm too lazy to do the right thing and migrate to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- I already had it running, so tweaking the template was an _easy_ hack

## Ok, so, how does it work?
1. Download the backup of your current Theme so you can rollback, if needed
1. Pick to use a 1st Generation Theme in Blogger
1. Select to Edit HTML
1. Copy the [blogger-css-grid-layout.html](blogger-css-grid-layout.html) into your HTML, and save
1. On the Customize Theme dropdown, set mobile settings to Desktop (so that it uses the new responsive view, instead of the default mobile-only view thing)

## Lots of TODOs?
- [x] Responsive
- [x] CSS Grid Layout
- [x] "Simple" - based on Awesome Inc. default Blogger template
- [x] Mobile friendly
- [ ] Cleanup the excess cruft of nested tags and complicated CSS styles
- [ ] Tweak design to be even cleaner
- [ ] Support for multiple "Pages"
- [ ] Give up and migrate to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) already
